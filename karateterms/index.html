Also, using the student&rsquo;s name to address them is much better than just calling them using a generic word.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c0">Praise Three Times</span><span class="c4">: Praising the student helps build his or her self-esteem and self-confidence during your interaction with them. It also makes the student have more fun while doing whatever the drill is. It can lighten their mood.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c0">Appropriate Touch Three Times</span><span class="c4">: Adding appropriate touch while talking to and teaching your student creates a better environment for both the student and the teacher. Some examples of appropriate include a high five, a fist bump, and a pat on the shoulder.</span></li></ol><ol class="c2 lst-kix_v5b01rg1yuxv-0" start="2"><li class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">SSL</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- three ways to create a productive yet fun class</span></li></ol><ol class="c2 lst-kix_v5b01rg1yuxv-1 start" start="1"><li class="c3"><span class="c0">Smiling</span><span class="c4">: Smiling lightens the mood for the group of students or student that you are teaching. Making the students smile does not only make them have fun, it also makes you have more fun while teaching.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c0">Sweating</span><span class="c4">: Sweating represents hard work during the class. This shows that your student is being productive and you are pushing the student to be the best they can. </span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c0">Learning</span><span class="c4">: Making sure that your student is going to get something out of the lesson is important. You want them to learn something from you so that they can improve whatever it is that they are currently doing or learn something new.</span></li></ol><ol class="c2 lst-kix_v5b01rg1yuxv-0" start="3"><li class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Hand-Hand-Foot-Foot</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- a teaching tool to help the teacher see the whole picture and correct as many mistakes as possible</span></li></ol><ol class="c2 lst-kix_v5b01rg1yuxv-1 start" start="1"><li class="c3"><span class="c4">Checking both hands and both feet makes it easier to catch more mistakes. This is especially important during forms classes and other times where technique is a key focus. This allows you as a teacher to see the whole picture and not make correcting one mistake make you miss another. For example, just because you correct the students thumb in a double knife does not mean that you should not check their back stance.</span></li></ol><ol class="c2 lst-kix_v5b01rg1yuxv-0" start="4"><li class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">PCP</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- a way to embed a correction without having the student feel worse about it</span></li></ol><ol class="c2 lst-kix_v5b01rg1yuxv-1 start" start="1"><li class="c3"><span class="c0">PCP </span><span class="c7">stands for </span><span class="c0">Praise</span><span class="c7">, </span><span class="c0">Correct</span><span class="c7">, </span><span class="c0">Praise</span><span class="c4">. This lets you hide a correction while making the students feel good. </span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c7">The initial </span><span class="c0">praise </span><span class="c4">can be on anything even as small as the way they are standing or them taking the time from their day to come to class.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c7">Then you can </span><span class="c0">correct </span><span class="c4">whatever mistake that you found. This should be done in a kind manner.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c7">Then, for the second </span><span class="c0">praise</span><span class="c4">, praise them on the improvement from the correction. Before you do this, it makes sense to watch them do it correctly a few times to make sure that they can do it repeatedly.</span></li></ol><ol class="c2 lst-kix_v5b01rg1yuxv-0" start="5"><li class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">CPR</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- a tool to correct a student while giving them advice on how to further improve it</span></li></ol><ol class="c2 lst-kix_v5b01rg1yuxv-1 start" start="1"><li class="c3"><span class="c0">CPR </span><span class="c7">stands for </span><span class="c0">Correct</span><span class="c7">, </span><span class="c0">Praise</span><span class="c7">, </span><span class="c0">Recommendation</span><span class="c4">.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c7">The first part of this is the </span><span class="c0">correction</span><span class="c4">. As stated previously in this document, this should be done in a kind and respectful manner.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c7">After correcting the student on their mistake, make sure that they can repeatedly do it correctly and </span><span class="c0">praise </span><span class="c4">them for their improvement.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c7">Lastly, give them a </span><span class="c0">recommendation </span><span class="c4">to further improve the technique corrected that they can work on at home such as doing a set of kicks every day to gain height on kicks. </span></li></ol><ol class="c2 lst-kix_v5b01rg1yuxv-0" start="6"><li class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Linking</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- chaining ideas together by making each idea flow into another to not overwhelm the student</span></li></ol><ol class="c2 lst-kix_v5b01rg1yuxv-1 start" start="1"><li class="c3"><span class="c0">While making corrections</span><span class="c4">, using linking is important so that the student does not get overwhelmed by multiple corrections all at once. Each correction should be looked at one at a time. Once a mistake is corrected move onto another. You should try to use some of the correcting strategies for as many of the corrections as possible.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c7">Using linking</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;while teaching</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is just as importing. The way to do this while teaching a form is to teach a few moves and then repeat those moves until the students master the moves. Once this is attained, you should add a few more moves and repeat the entire thing multiple times so that the students review the previously learned content as well as master the new moves. Then repeat this process as many times as necessary to teach the students more as well as have them master what was previously learned.</span></li></ol><ol class="c2 lst-kix_v5b01rg1yuxv-0" start="7"><li class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Lighthouse</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- looking far and being able to catch mistakes at a distance, but failing to see the mistakes right in front of you</span></li></ol><ol class="c2 lst-kix_v5b01rg1yuxv-1 start" start="1"><li class="c3"><span class="c4">This is not something that you want to do. Make sure that you pay attention to everything, especially your own area. Lighthouses can only see things from afar; they cannot see anything close to them.</span></li></ol><ol class="c2 lst-kix_v5b01rg1yuxv-0" start="8"><li class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Corners</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- starting in one corner of the room and getting to the other interacting with each group in the process</span></li></ol><ol class="c2 lst-kix_v5b01rg1yuxv-1 start" start="1"><li class="c3"><span class="c4">Using corners allows you to interact with each group on the floor in a timely manner. For example, if there are two lines of groups on the floor then by starting at one corner and moving to other, you can interact with every group in a few minutes as long as you spend around 10-15 seconds on each group. This is an efficient way to interact with every group.</span></li></ol><ol class="c2 lst-kix_v5b01rg1yuxv-0" start="9"><li class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Scanning</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- looking at everywhere instead of being confined to only helping in one area</span></li></ol><ol class="c2 lst-kix_v5b01rg1yuxv-1 start" start="1"><li class="c3"><span class="c4">This means to keep looking around everywhere for major concerns or mistakes to correct. This technique allows you to cover more ground as a helper in class. Also, while scanning, it makes sense to attempt to correct the mistakes in the most efficient way possible by going down rows or diagonals and correcting mistakes that are near each other. Scanning also allows you to prioritize the biggest problem and fix them first. Going down rows and prioritizing problems can be done since scanning allows you to see a larger area including more problems to fix.</span></li></ol><ol class="c2 lst-kix_v5b01rg1yuxv-0" start="10"><li class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">Zones</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- splitting all the helpers up so that each person covers their own sections so that overall the entire floor is covered</span></li></ol><ol class="c2 lst-kix_v5b01rg1yuxv-1 start" start="1"><li class="c3"><span class="c4">When you are split up into zones, the zone you are given is your responsibility. Unless there is a major safety concern, you should try your best to stay within your zone and focus on making your zone the best it can be by correcting any mistakes or problems. Try not to focus on finding mistakes on other zones since that time would be better spent watching over your zone.</span></li></ol><ol class="c2 lst-kix_v5b01rg1yuxv-0" start="11"><li class="c1"><span class="c8 c0">White on Rice</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;- staying with one student no matter what for the entire class</span></li></ol><ol class="c2 lst-kix_v5b01rg1yuxv-1 start" start="1"><li class="c3"><span class="c7">This means to stick with one kid the way that white stays on rice. You want to focus on this kid and stay with them for the entirety of the class. When an instructor or higher level member tells you to stick with one kid the way white is on rice, it means to stay with them, go where they go, and correct their mistakes.</span></li></ol></body></html>
